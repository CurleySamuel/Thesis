The 1890's Colonial perched upon the land awaits a visionary.  A second structure, once a store to the Tuttle family until the early 1900's, was converted to a one bedroom home.  There is a one car garage and remnants of structures from years gone by.  A bit of nostalgia on the American Mile.

Are you looking for an affordable home in Concord that you can upgrade, and/or renovate and make even better than the original? Then you need to consider this 1970 Deck House. The sellers have reduced the list price and installed new wood floors and carpeting on the main level.  Resting on a nearly 2-acre wooded lot on a cul-de-sac in a West Concord neighborhood with great commuter access, this home features all the elements you would expect in a 1970 Deck House – split entry, wood cathedral ceilings, fireplaces, emphasis on the use of natural woods, large unobstructed windows, a large deck, clean efficient lines, open space, and a modernist feel. A surprise in this home is the way the lower level is configured with a separate entrance, kitchen area, full bath and bedroom – perfect for extended families or an au pair. The roof was replaced, the chimney rebuilt and the home brought up to code for insulation in October 2009.

Designed by The Architect's Collaborative, the firm started by Walter Gropius, this is the only house designed by Gropius's firm in Concord, Massachusetts.  Quintessential Mid-Century Modern. The architecture is based on the design philosophy that Gropius and a group of architects, artists and thinkers developed while teaching at the Bauhaus in Weimar, Germany. The current owners purchased the property in 2008 and over a two year period, completely restored the house back to its original exterior, and added a second floor bedroom / studio above the existing two car garage.  The original blue prints were used to guide the restoration and fabrication of the architectural details. Internally, the house was completely rebuilt with new floors, walls, ceilings, plumbing and mechanical systems.  The siting and design of the house are life enhancing and create a visceral connection to the land and the property’s meandering stream.
