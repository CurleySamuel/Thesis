Do you have the vision to transform this modest Colonial into the home you want it to be? Former 1960’s Ranch, added on to over the years, offers a ton of potential with ~2,000 sf. of living space, not counting mostly-finished basement. Quirky as its floor plan may be, this home is charming & old-fashioned, in a retro kind of way. Fundamentals are in place; either a soft renovation or a complete facelift will make it shine. Charming arched openings connect kitchen & living rm & dining rm. Check out vintage stove in kitchen! It appears to have oak floors under carpeting in original part of house on first floor. Second floor & Sun Room were likely added later, maybe in the 1970’s? Currently 2 true bedrooms, one on 1st floor & master BR on 2nd floor. 3rd BR could be created. Small room next to master BR could be nursery or walk-in closet. 2 full baths, mostly finished basement for more space.
