Featured in This Old House magazine in 2003, the house successfully blends the modern with the traditional, keeping consistent in outward appearance with its neighbors, while the renovation opened up the floor plan with volume and light. There are plenty of pleasant surprises once a visitor steps in off the traditional front porch. A stained-glass window adds a churchly light in the cathedral-ceilinged living room, which is open to the dining room beside it and a catwalk library above. A master suite has an office loft above a fireplace. A tower in the rear of the house contains an artist studio/office, with lots of light. A second stairway leads back down to where most people will likely want to spend the bulk of their time, in the family room, with another fireplace and a breakfast bar open to the modern kitchen. A curved wall of windows overlooks the deck & lush back yard.
