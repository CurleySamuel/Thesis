# A Hard Look at the Soft Science of Real Estate: Predicting Boston Area Home Sale Prices Using Only Physical Features

# Abstract

Predicting the sale price of a home is easy when given the entire history of the property including past sale prices, tax assessments, and physical attributes. Take the localized market growth, apply it to the last sale price and tack on any additions or subtractions to credit new features. However predicting the sale price of a home when given only physical attributes is a much harder problem. The regression models are no longer seeded with a known historical baseline - they instead have to look a layer deeper and start attributing features with values, location coordinates with land value, and realtor comments with discrete dollar deltas.

The goal isn't to beat common home valuation tools like Zillow and Redfin at their own game. Instead the goal is to get similar accuracy using a much smaller subset of data for each home, not to mention a much smaller amount of training data. The smaller dependence on data opens more doors as there's no longer a strict dependence on having historical data and tax information. Using only fourteen features which can easily be specified by a user on a phone we can generate a valuation that's almost as good as one based on myriad data sources and historical data that may or may not be emotionally influenced.
